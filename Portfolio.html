     <h2>Product Packaging</h2>
     	<p>One of the larger projects I've completed was a product packaging design. For this project, I began by making up a product—a spring blend coffee in Keurig cups—and writing a profile describing the company and the coffee product. After defining the company and product, I then designed a logo and choose the fonts, colors, and images that I felt were good representation of a Spring Blend. Then, using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, I designed the individual Keurig cup lid, a flat package box mock-up, and a three-dimensional package box mock-up.</p>

     <h2>Creative Works and Research Symposium</h2>
     	<p>For Eastern’s Creative Works and Research Symposium, I designed a poster with a flowchart outlining internship benefits, challenges, and some tips. Most of the information in the poster was gathered from my personal experience during my internship with a local manufacturing company. In addition, I also did further research and found some helpful tips and things interns should be aware of.</p>

<p>Designing large can be a challenge when it comes to deciding font size, as well as poster colors and layout. But I feel the layout and flow of information transitions nicely, and as I’m a technical communicator I think you can never go wrong with a flowchart to demonstrate concepts.</p>

     <h2>Proposal Writing</h2>
     	<p>One community engagement project I participated in was creating a template and style guide for the manufacturing company Kaiser Aluminum. The end deliverables to the client included a template for them to build work job plan, in addition to a style guide to help them format the plans. Before creating the deliverables, my group attended a client meeting and then produced a proposal outlining our understanding of the project and client’s needs for approval.</p>

<p>This proposal was a team effort in that we met as a group to discuss the project goals, timeline, and work distribution. After discussing the details as a team, I wrote most of the sections, then edited and formatted the document for submission. The client was pleased with the proposal and accepted it without any addendums.</p>

<p>A challenge that we faced during in creating the proposal was listing the tasks to complete the project. The client’s need was clear, but identifying the best way to create documents was difficult as we lacked information on the software the client used to create the job plans. To overcome this challenge, the tasks listed were more broad than we thought ideal. </p>

    <h2>Instructions and Procedures</h2>
     	<p>At a ten-month internship with a manufacturing company, one project I was in charge of was creating lockout/tagout procedures and job hazard analyses for the shop machinery. This required me to work closely with millwrights, machine operators, and supervisors to ensure the documents were thorough and accurate. Because these were so many potential audiences of these document with different experience levels and even spoken languages, the documents needed to be short, precise, and consistent.</p>
