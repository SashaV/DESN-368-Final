   			 <p> Hello! I'm Sasha Vogele, and I enjoy communicating through effectively combining words and design.

	<p>Hey!</p>

<p>My name's Sasha, and I'm about to graduate with a B.A. in Technical Communications from Eastern Washington University. I choose a Technical Communications degree because I like to write--and write well. And not just one type of writing either, but all types such as professional, news, grant, procedural, and promotional.</p> 

<p>In addition to effectively communicating through writing, my degree and experience includes knowledge of how to reach viewers through logical and aesthetically pleasing designs. Nobody wants to spend their time looking at documents that aren't legible and interesting to see, so words and design should always be one with the other. </p>

<p>There are so many different methods and strategies in communication, but it all essentially really comes down to whether or not your audience is effectively receiving the message you want them to. </p>

<p>So, if you think you might have any writing, editing, or design work that you'd like professional help with, please contact me!</p>
